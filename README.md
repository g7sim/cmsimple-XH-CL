# Cmsimple-XC - beta 5  

* This git contains a  modified  Fork of Cmsimple XH 1.7.2 with clean urls and a http - security filter and several corrected issues until XH - version 1.74

* It has the same GPL3  license (Licenses of plugins are to be observed) - there ist also a Wikipedia article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMSimple about Cmsimple

* It needs at least php 5.6+ (not php 5.3 !)  and is tested with php 7.4

* It offers both tinymce4.83 (with bootstrap - plugins under configuration : flexible) and tinymce 5.3.1 and a version of CKEDITOR 4.16, which allows simple adding of a plugin by extraction into the plugins_external - directory (with dependencies!). Besides https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addons/plugins/all are at github more than 20 bootstrap-plugins from sestolab(based on smethods), akilli etc. ( and my https://github.com/g7sim/ckeditor-fa4-fa5-XH FA4.7 - FA5.13 - XH - plugin )

* The inbuilt FA 4.7 - font of the FA-Plugin has been replaced by free Font Awesome 5.15.

* This version has an integrated full-backup from the Cmsimple_XH - forum ( start with : ...com/backup ). The zip  appears after a long while under userfiles (filebrowser) and is there ready for download.

* You may not use ( ) ] [ < = or ? in links ) - also for security reasons

* It has at the moment still a limitation in WINDOWS (like Xampp etc.) :  URI-pathes which begin with /plugins or /cmsimple or /templates or   /content or /assets - which have their equivalent in first level of the CMS-structure - are  not allowed in Windows - but function in the Web!) 

* It is not yet full compatible with the FHS_Adminmenu-plugin - maybe in a future version, but with hi_admin https://github.com/TN03/hi_admin_xh , and most of the 1.7x - plugins function.

* The final version will have a different admin-ui and other templates inklusive Bootstrap ( https://github.com/g7sim/Bootstrap3-XH  and https://github.com/g7sim/Bootstrap4-XH ) and https://github.com/g7sim/Smartmenus-XH as You can find them in this git.

* If You find bugs, please make an issue (or post in the forum). You may also make a fork and a push with Your solution.
