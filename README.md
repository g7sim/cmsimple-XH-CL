* You should use at least php 7.0 (not php 5.3 !),  and it is tested with php 7.4 and php 8.0

* It offers both tinymce 4.91 (with bootstrap - plugins under configuration : flexible) and 

* tinymce 5.3.1 (for professional use You may need a license )

* a version of CKEDITOR 4.16, which allows simple adding of a plugin by extraction into the plugins_external - directory (with dependencies!). Besides https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addons/plugins/all are at github more than 20 bootstrap-plugins from sestolab(based on smethods), akilli etc.
